# Summary

_Explore your data set and craft a message or story around your data!
Think about the overall message you want to convey and think about the
comparison(s) or relationship(s) you want your readers to see.
Remember that you will ultimately need to create a visualization that
is explanatory, helping lead a reader to identify one or more key insights
into the dataset. Feel free to use whatever visualization and data analysis
tools you feel comfortable with using: you won't need to use dimple.js
or d3.js at this point of the process._

https://www.bts.gov/ throughout the years 2003 - 2017.
