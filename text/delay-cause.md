The majority of delays (33%) are caused by carriers (red line). The second largest group in 2003,
the National Aviation System (NAS) has reduced its impact on delays from 35% in 2003 to 25% (yellow). 
While this indicates an efficiency gain in running the NAS, however this trend could also mean a statistical 
shift in the data. Consider that late arriving aircraft (green) as a cause of delays have increased dramatically and
are now the cause of 33% of all delayed flights. Late arriving aircraft are reported when a previous flight
with the same plane was delayed - no matter what the cause. 

It is interesting that delays due to extreme weather conditions which stop any flight from departing or landing
are rare and well below 5% (blue). The same is true for delays cause by security measures.
