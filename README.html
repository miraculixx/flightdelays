<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Flight delays are a cause of dissatisfaction for most if not all airline passengers. This story looks
at the cause of flight delays using data provided by the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics,
https://www.bts.gov/ throughout the years 2003 - 2017. The story shows that just 3 carriers have caused 
1/3 of all delays, and that most delays are caused by the airlines and the national aviation system (NAS)
and operating in highly frequented regions across the US. Surprisingly, the often suspected extreme weather 
conditions and security checks at airports cause less than 5% of all delays.</p>
<h1 id="design">Design</h1>
<p>My design choices after a few iterations (see below) were as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use a line plot to show change of the causes (in percent) over time. I tried a few other 
   options like box plots and bar charts, however they were hard to read and did really convey
   the message (in particular, that some causes have increased or declined where others are
   stable or even negligible). The line plot includes a color key as a legend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a bar chart to show cause of delays by carrier, overall. I tried a pie chart but found
   it hard to interpret. The bar chart is clean and conveys the information very well.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a map to show where (in which regions) the most delays occur. I found a map to be a naturual
   way to depict this information, since the data is aggregated by geographical region. The downside
   is that the map does not allow a quick realization of actual figures, so I added a few interesting
   data points in the explanatory text next to the plot.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Following feedback received by the kind people in the Udacity formus, I have adjusted the design as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Variables are now labeled properly, in plain English (instead of their technical names)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All plots' axis grids are reduced to the minimum, in particular the line plot does not have any
  grid lines, the bar chart only shows horizontal grid lines. This improves readability and is really
  pleasing for the eye.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The line plots's stroke width was increase to make the colors more easily visible and comparable to the
  legend.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Prior to publishing my visualization, I already tried out several ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Adding a "year selector" to each graph, so that only particular years would be shown. This proved
  to be quite complex and destracting, so I removed it again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a box plot on percentage of delayed flights, by airport and year. This was an interesting plot
  during data exploration, but it proved too complex to show in the final report. In particular there are
  so many outliers that one can hardly see anything on the plot.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Nice charts, I am able to understand them all, because I was working on the flight delay dataset too.
   Other viewer may have label problem to understand.
   "Arr_Del15” is better to change to “Arrived Delay”(or something else) with a percentage value in the second chart.

<p>for the first graph, I noticed the coloring for the line graph was hard to distinguish, when referring to the legend. This issue was resolved when the user hovered over the line.

<p>Coming to the second graph, I noticed the gridline in the background. It didn’t truly distract me from the graph, but it can be a cause of distraction for visualization, per lesson plan.

<p>I enjoyed reading your project. The format and documented transitions were appealing for an exploratory data analysis project.
   The third graph looked good! I didn’t feel there were any necessary alterations for it.

<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>The app is implemented in a modularized approach using requirejs AMD modules. Backbone.js is used to implement
the plots (as Views). In this model, the index.html provides the page layout, app.js implements application
logic by instantiating views as specified (declarative), and the views modules implement and encapsulate all
the d3 and d3plus logic. This separation of concerns has many advantages, in particular the app is easier to
extend and change. In addition, most of the code is independent of the specific data and could be easily 
adopted to a different data set and a different data story.</p>
